# Test Document with TextIndex Syntax

This is a test document to demonstrate TextIndex syntax.

## Introduction

Most mechanical keyboard firmware{^} supports the use of
[key combinations]{^}.

## Protocols

HTTP{^} is a protocol{^} used for web communication. The
HTTP protocol{^} has several versions.

### HTTP/1.1

## Security

Security{^} is important. We discuss encryption{^} and
authentication{^}.

### Encryption Methods

Symmetric encryption{^} uses the same key for encryption and
decryption.

Asymmetric encryption{^} uses different keys.

## Conclusion

This concludes our test of TextIndex syntax.
