# Test Document with mmark Index Syntax

This is a test document to demonstrate mmark index syntax.

## Introduction

This document contains various topics that will be indexed. We have protocols (!Protocol) and implementations (!Implementation).

## Section on HTTP

HTTP (!HTTP) is a protocol (!Protocol) used for web communication. The HTTP protocol (!Protocol) has several versions.

### HTTP/1.1

### Encryption Methods

Symmetric encryption (!Encryption, Symmetric) uses the same key for encryption and decryption.

Asymmetric encryption (!Encryption, Asymmetric) uses different keys.

## Primary Index Entry

This section discusses the primary topic (!!Primary Topic, Sub Topic).

## Section-Level Index

(!Section Index Entry)

This entire section should be indexed as "Section Index Entry".

## Conclusion

This concludes our test of index syntax.
